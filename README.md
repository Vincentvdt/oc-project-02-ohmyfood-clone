# Ohmyfood – OC Project 02 🍲

Mobile-first restaurant menu platform for a fictional gourmet food startup expanding from NYC to Paris.  

Built with love, animations, and clean code — **but I didn’t design it**. Keep reading 😌👇

---

## 🚀 Project context

This project was developed as part of the **Développeur d'application - JavaScript React** formation at OpenClassrooms.  
The mission: turn a provided Figma mockup into a responsive, animated restaurant site.  
The design? Already done. My job? Bring it to life — mobile-first, smooth, and pixel-perfect.

Ohmyfood is a fictional startup aiming to reduce restaurant wait times by letting users **pre-compose meals online**. The app showcases four gastronomic menus, animated interactions, and a polished responsive layout.

## ⚠️ Design Disclaimer

**I didn’t design this**. The Figma mockups and UX flows were handed to me as part of the assignment.  
So if you’re side-eyeing the fonts, colors, layout choices, or even the **animations**, that’s not my doing 😅  
My role was to **integrate** everything faithfully as specified. I focused on code quality, responsiveness, and smooth execution,  
not on choosing the aesthetics or interactions. Blame the pixels, not the coder.
